Hi there! I'm a computer science major with a passion for software development and a strong skillset in programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, C++, Java, MIPS, and X86. My interests extend beyond just coding, as I'm also deeply interested in cyber security and entrepreneurship. I believe that the combination of my technical skills and my drive to innovate and create will serve me well in my future endeavors.

I have a diverse portfolio of projects that showcases my skills and creativity. For example, I built a paper trading bot called "Stonk Bot" that is used in Discord to buy and sell stocks or crypto. I also have hardware projects, such as a turret that uses stepper motors and OpenCV for object detection. I have a passion for 3D printing and have even tried my hand at PCB design for an LED project. I also developed an online price monitor bot for NFT's, which was widely used during the NFT hype train.

My experience as the president of a college Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) club further demonstrates my leadership potential and my ability to work well in a team. Building underwater robots requires a unique combination of technical expertise, project management skills, and teamwork, and my experience in this role has helped me develop valuable skills that will be useful to me as I progress in my career. By leading a team of students in this club, I have honed my communication skills and my ability to think outside the box to find creative solutions to complex problems.

All of these experiences and interests are aligned with my goals as a computer science major, and I am confident that they will serve me well as I pursue my career in the tech industry.
